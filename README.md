[b]Addon Name:[/b] Barny's CC Tracker

[b]Description:[/b]
Barny's CC Tracker is an addon for [i]The Elder Scrolls Online[/i] that helps players keep track of crowd control (CC) effects during combat. CC effects include abilities like stuns, snares, and roots that temporarily limit your characterâ€™s movement or actions. This addon displays icons whenever your character is affected by a CC ability, letting you know which effect is active. It also tracks when a CC ends, updating the display automatically. This helps players react faster in combat by knowing exactly what kind of effect is limiting them.
